â€œAutomates prospect research for sales teams."

PURPOSE ðŸ’­
To help sales reps prepare for calls better by creating handy research tools that collect data on prospects and
their company from across the web, which can be used to generate a pre-call report for them to use before â€¨taking each call.

VALUE ðŸ¤‘
When reps know more about the people they are speaking with it makes it much easier to build trust as theâ€¨prospect feels the company has taken the time to prepare. Better preparation can also reveal effective anglesâ€¨to sell through as well. Ultimately, this should increase the conversion rate of the sales team.

USAGE ðŸŽ¬

They provide the company URL and get back the company research
Then they provide the prospects LinkedIn URL and get back the prospect research
Then they ask for a pre-call report, and it is generated for them to read

TECH USED ðŸ§ : e.g., Relevance(no code platform), Firecrawl(Website scraper), tools to research user's Linkedin & Company website, OpenAI API,
